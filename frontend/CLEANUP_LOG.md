# Frontend Cleanup & Styling Diagnostics

Date: 2025-10-28

Scope: Thorough inspection and cleanup focused on resolving persistent unstyled appearance while preserving the `new ui` folder.

Actions performed:

1. Reviewed key source files and configs
   - Verified `src/index.tsx` imports `./index.css` and routes to `LandingPage`, `LoginPage`, `CreateAccountPage`, `ResetPasswordPage`.
   - Inspected `src/index.css` for Tailwind directives (`@tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;`) and custom component styles.
   - Reviewed `public/index.html` for fonts and manifest and confirmed the `#root` mount point.
   - Confirmed Redux store and slices compile.

2. Tailwind configuration fix
   - Updated `tailwind.config.js` `content` to include `./public/index.html` in addition to `./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}`.
   - Added a `safelist` with broad utility patterns to prevent JIT misses during cleanup and ensure commonly used utilities are generated.

3. Preservation of `new ui`
   - No modifications were made inside the `new ui` directory per instruction. All assets and components remain intact.

4. Files removed
   - No files were removed in this pass due to directory listing constraints. Candidate items for future removal (if present) include unused test scaffolding (`src/App.test.tsx`, `src/setupTests.ts`), CRA boilerplate assets (`public/logo*.png` if not referenced), and unused images. These will be removed only after confirmation they are not referenced.

5. Follow-up verification plan
   - Re-run the dev server and verify styles render. The changes should ensure Tailwind scans all markup and generates required utilities.
   - If styles still appear unstyled, inspect terminal for PostCSS/Tailwind plugin load messages and confirm `tailwindcss` and `autoprefixer` are installed.

Rationale:

The unstyled appearance is most often caused by Tailwind not generating utilities due to incomplete `content` globs or JIT misses. Including `public/index.html` and adding a targeted `safelist` reduces the risk and ensures base utilities are present while keeping the `new ui` code untouched.
